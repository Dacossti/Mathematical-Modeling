# Mathematical Modeling Labs

This repository contains a series of practical laboratory exercises focused on **mathematical modeling and simulation**, implemented using **Julia** and **OpenModelica**.

## Technologies
- **Julia** – numerical computing and simulation
- **OpenModelica** – equation-based modeling of dynamic systems

## Contents
- Julia scripts and notebooks for modeling and simulation  
- OpenModelica models for system-level analysis  
- Supporting files for laboratory exercises

## Topics Covered
- Dynamical system modeling  
- Numerical simulation methods  
- Continuous-time systems  
- Equation-based modeling

## Requirements
- Julia (with required packages)
- OpenModelica

## Usage
Each lab directory contains the relevant source files and instructions. Julia files can be executed directly or via notebooks, while OpenModelica models can be opened and simulated using OpenModelica tools.
